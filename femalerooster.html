			<p class="headeratwo" style="text-align: left;color: #9b8a00;margin-top:0px;" >logo exploration:</p>
			<p class="athree" style="text-align: left;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;" >While doing my initial logo exploration and sketches for this project, I thought about how to combine three primary concepts that fed into Female Rooster: a female rooster (what it was called), a punk band (what it was), and feminism (what it was driven by). For me, depicting a rooster or a band was fairly straightforward, but once I started thinking about how to incorporate the driving femininity of Female Rooster, I then had to think about feminist symbols and representations of womanhood.</p>
			<p class="athree" style="text-align: left;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;" >When you google “feminist symbol”, the image you will see the most is that of the venus symbol - a tried and true symbol of womanhood, the venus is a symbol of gender, not sex. Many of these venus symbols also include a fist inside the upper circle, representing resistance and liberation. However, many of the other feminist symbols that you may see both through a search and incorporated into feminist or female-centered logos, brands, and merchandise are anatomical images as mentioned before: The uterus, the womb, the vagina and other vagina depictions (i.e. pussycats, orchids or other flowers that represent vaginas). These images may be feminist symbols, but they are not symbols of feminism.</p>
			<p class="athree" style="text-align: left;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;" >Many of the original logo designs that I created during brainstorming incorporated these anatomical components like the uterus or the vagina. In many ways these symbols are effective and necessary, relevant to feminist issues like reproductive rights and bodily autonomy, impactful in their display of the taboo and important for normalizing and desexualizing the body as well as accepting sexuality. However, as an overarching feminist symbol they are clearly insufficient. Feminism and femininity are a broad umbrella, which is part of what makes them so difficult to represent visually, but to have a representative symbol that so clearly excludes significant demographics such as trans and intersex people is harmful and a misrepresentation of what feminism really is.</p>

			<p class="athree" style="text-align: left;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;" >One situation that garnered significant attention for its exclusionary symbolism was the Women’s March in Washington in 2017 - a march that was heavily characterized by the wave of pink pussy hats that many of the marchers wore, a direct response to a comment the then president Donald Trump had made about his freedom to grab women’s genitals. The pussy hat represented many great things - solidarity, self-ownership of one’s body, encouragement of traditionally female hobbies like knitting, the accessibility of anyone being able to make such a hat themselves, etc., but it garnered many mixed responses. In response to this sea of pink rose think pieces questioning the white, cis-gendered representation of feminism that this pussy hat represented. In reading some of these articles, I found lots of justified frustration with the continuous centering of feminism around these same female figures - straight women, white women, and cisgendered women. These articles addressed how something as seemingly innocuous as a knitted hat with cat ears is part of a larger issue which further divides women as a community. However, despite the issues many had with these pussy hats, I didn’t see many people offering solutions - specifically, alternative symbolism. This issue was relevant to my own exploration, as I didn’t want to use symbolism which misrepresented my concept in the ways many claimed the pussy hats had, but I still had to consider which imagery would actually be accurate.</p>
			<p class="athree" style="text-align: left;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;" >Thankfully, feminism is a long standing movement which has had many different faces. Some historical feminist symbols are less potent today - stars; purple, white, and gold; and jail cell doors to name a few. Some of these symbols are associated with specific movements like suffrage, and so have become less necessary in feminism’s current battles. In searching, I also found many emblems besides the venus symbol - Venus the planet, a venus fly trap, red lipstick, a mouth with teeth, bows (made especially popular recently in 2024 with the rise of the “coquette” trend). Obviously these things are not exclusive to women, but they are still associated with femininity and can be used to represent it. Another category that may go underappreciated - bugs. Female praying mantises often devour the male after or sometimes during mating, the female black widow does the same, only female bees and wasps have stingers, and even the lady bug may be applicable - the female lady bug is not significantly different from the male, but their name and appearance could qualify them as feminist icons.</p>

This put inclusive and intersectional feminist iconography pretty high on the list of importance. Because of the name - Female Rooster - it was also important for me to consider gender not just as femininity, but as a subversion of the gender binary. With a name like Female Rooster, any symbols relating feminism to female anatomy seem ill-fitting and incomplete. In the end, I combined all three of my concepts into one - a rooster, an electric guitar, the venus symbol.</p>
