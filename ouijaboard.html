After this, my next step was to establish the connection of two “boards” - I needed two different devices to connect and send their information (that information being mouse location) back and forth. For the parameters of this assignment, I established a local connection, so the site that hosts the ouija board would be launched through one’s ip address and connection would be possible through two devices on the same wifi network. This also allows me to easily limit the site to two people at a time, since only I would be launching the site. If an entity does control the ouija board, this also might help with any issue relating to proximity and the difficulties it might pose for them to control two devices far away from each other.</p>

The people who tried this version of my program had no trouble understanding what they were supposed to do, but with the program set up as it was, it took about two minutes for the two devices to get a “match”. I did not want a match to necessarily take that long, so I made sure that I adjusted the program slightly so that length of time may be shortened. I made the proximity range that determined a match slightly larger and I slowed down the movement of the planchette slightly. There were other aspects which I had already planned on incorporating into my more final version which also increase likelihood of a match - such as adding a delay to the movement of the planchette following the pointer, and including the image of the board itself, which gives both context of what is trying to be achieved and more specific locations to aim for.</p>
